# CSD_toolbox

The CSD toolbox solves Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models using perturbation methods with Matlab. The toolbox is completely based on the CoRRAM-M toolkit (2018 version) developed by Professor Alfred Maussner. CSD is an acronym for Corram Simplified Design, and is written by Sijmen Duineveld. The toolbox can solve limit cycle models using code developed by Dana Galizia.
